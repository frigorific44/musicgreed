## musicgreed

A command-line tool to aid in collecting music.

### Synopsis

MusicGreed aims to speed up efforts to build a complete digital music collection. This is done by using `setcover` to calculate a collection goal for a music artist, or `remainder` to calculate the set cover on the tracks missing from a current collection (feature to come).

### Options

```
  -h, --help            help for musicgreed
  -o, --output string   path to log output file
```
