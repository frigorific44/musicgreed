## musicgreed setcover

Compute the set cover for the complete song collection of an artist.

### Synopsis

This command computes the minimal set of releases needed to contain every unique track released by an artist. In addition, the unique contribution of each release it output to assist a song collector's efforts. Available flags may help to filter out music tracks that aren't of concern, depending on desired thoroughness.

To discard live and remixed releases:

`musicgreed setcover --dsec="live,remix" artist`

The previous command can only discard whole releases tagged as mentioned. To discard individual tracks that are parenthesized as an alternate version:

`musicgreed setcover --dalt artist`

If you maintain your library with the beets library manager, you can exclude your collection from `setcover` with the remainder flag:

`musicgreed setcover -r artist`

```
musicgreed setcover artist [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --dalt           discard parenthesized alternate tracks (acoustic, remix, etc.)
      --dsec strings   discard MusicBrainz secondary release group types (https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release_Group/Type)
  -h, --help           help for setcover
      --official       only official releases (https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release#Status)
  -r, --remainder      requires a beets music library; calculates on the remainder after library tracks
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -o, --output string   path to log output file
```
