## musicgreed setcover

Compute the set cover for the complete song collection of an artist.

### Synopsis

This command computes the minimal set of releases needed to contain
every unique track released by an artist. In addition, the unique contribution of
each release it output to to assist a song collector's efforts. Available flags
may help to filter out music tracks that aren't of concern, depending on desired
thoroughness:

To discard live and remixed releases:
musicgreed setcover "MBID" --dsec="live,remix"

The previous command can only discard whole releases tagged as mentioned. To
discard individual tracks that are parenthesized as an alternate version:
musicgreed setcover "MBID" --dalt

```
musicgreed setcover "MBID" [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --dalt           discard parenthesized alternate tracks (acoustic, remix, etc.)
      --dsec strings   discard MusicBrainz secondary release group types (https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release_Group/Type)
  -h, --help           help for setcover
```
